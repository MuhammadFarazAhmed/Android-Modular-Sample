# Android-Modular-Sample
This sample project shows layer/modular approach, that provides great deal of abstraction for developing better android apps 

#### Why do we need to use this approach?  
-  When there is a **large team working on the same app**, its really hard to keep track of other team members code, you would have to make multiple branches in git to keep track.  
- When the **app you are working on covers a very large scope**, then there will be alot of code and managing the code can be a very difficult thing.  

**Using a modular approach will cover both of these problems.**

 #### Things you should know about when you are implementing this approach:
 
 - MVVM Pattern
 - The Clean Architecture Pattern
 - Android Jetpack (LiveData & ViewModel)
 - Data Binding
 - Kotlin Coroutines
 - Retrofit2 and Room
